# Dynamic fingerprints
Sample code to reproduce results of the manuscript *"When makes you unique: Temporality of the human brain fingerprint"* by Van De Ville et al., Science Advances 2021. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj0751


The code generates Fig.2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 of the paper. More comment and details are provided within the main scripts (i.e., "batch_plot"). Some sample data are included in the repo to make the code standalone.

Please note that the code for the NeuroSynth analysis (Fig. 5) can be downloaded from: https://www.github.com/gpreti/GSP_StructuralDecouplingIndex

Code Author: Enrico Amico.
